This project actually wasn't that terrible. I found myself getting through it a lot faster than the last project. CSS definitely makes it easier but I did have some trouble on a few things. 
I challenged myself to not use CHatGPT for this and I only had to use it once to figuer out how to get the decoratvie line under the headers. Other than that, any time I had a question about
a design or I wasn't sure how to implement something I turned to sites like W3 schools or other forums in which other people had the same problem. I think this helped me learn it a lot
better and I was able to understand things more. Once I figure out one thing the rest was pretty simple and I was able to do everyhting by myself for the most part.
